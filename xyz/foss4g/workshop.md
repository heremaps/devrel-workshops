## HERE XYZ CLI

*60min*

Using XYZ with other tools and renders (30 mins)

- mapshaper
  - converting state plane
  - simplify polygons
- Tangram
  - show vector tile endpoint
  - show tags
- Leaflet
- point to Stamen examples
- QGIS XYZ plugin (reading from earthquake data, some sort of GIS magic -- PIP?)

Intermediate Activity:
- add a shapefile (tectonic plates) with the CLI, add that space to the earthquake map in Studio
- import csv (unusual lat/lon fields)
- add tags during upload
- streaming large files
- geojsonl 
- space invader preview

## HERE XYZ APIs and HERE Location Services

*60 mins*

- routing
